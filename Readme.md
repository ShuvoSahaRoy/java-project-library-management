# Requirements and Tools:
I did this project on Netbeans IDE.

You check this on your side. But You need to add three jar file.

* jcalendar-1.4.jar
* sqlite-jdbc.jar
* rs2xml.jar

Just go to project properties of Netbeans > Libraries > Add Jar/folder. That's it. 👍

Don't forget to resolve those issue by adding jar files.

The zip file contains the whole project that can be easily implemented.
